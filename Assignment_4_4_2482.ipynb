            "In this simulated chatbot query classification scenario, all methods (rule-based, zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot) achieved 100.00% accuracy. This consistent high performance is attributed to the straightforward nature of the queries and the effective keyword matching logic implemented in the `predict_query_type_rule_based` function. The keyword sets were distinct enough for each category, leading to unambiguous predictions in this controlled environment.\n",
            "In a real-world scenario with more complex and ambiguous queries, we would expect variations in performance across prompting methods. Few-shot prompting, by providing multiple examples, often helps LLMs understand nuances and handle ambiguities better than zero-shot or one-shot, leading to improved accuracy.\n",
